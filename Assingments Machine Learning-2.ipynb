    "#Consequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "#- Poor generalization to new data\n",
    "#- High variance in predictions\n",

    "##Q2: How can we reduce overfitting? Explain in brief.\n",
    "\n",
    "#To reduce overfitting, you can employ several techniques to improve the modelâ€™s generalization to unseen data:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Regularization: Apply regularization methods like L1 (Lasso) or L2 (Ridge) regularization to penalize large coefficients and prevent the model from becoming overly complex.\n",

    "#Pruning: For decision trees, use pruning methods to limit the depth and complexity of the tree, reducing its ability to fit noise.\n",

    "#Dropout: In neural networks, apply dropout to randomly drop neurons during training, which helps prevent the model from relying too heavily on specific features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Simplify the Model: Choose a less complex model or reduce the number of parameters to ensure it does not overfit the training data.\n",

    "#Early Stopping: Monitor model performance on a validation set and stop training when performance starts to degrade, preventing the model from learning the noise in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Increase Training Data: Collect more training data to provide a broader range of examples, which helps the model learn more general patterns and reduces the likelihood of overfitting."

    "#Definition: Underfitting occurs when a machine learning model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns and relationships in the data. This happens when the model lacks the complexity needed to fit the training data well, resulting in poor performance on both the training and test datasets.\n",

    "#Characteristics of Underfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "#High Bias: The model makes strong assumptions and does not capture the underlying structure of the data.\n",

    "#cenario: Using too few features to represent the complexity of the data.\n",

    "#Example: Using a shallow neural network with too few layers or neurons to capture the complexity of the data.\n",
    "#Mitigating Underfitting\n",
    "#Increase Model Complexity: Use more complex models or algorithms that can capture more intricate patterns (e.g., switching from linear regression to polynomial regression or using more layers in a neural network).\n",
    "#Add More Features: Include additional relevant features or interactions between features to provide more information to the model.\n",
    "#Reduce Regularization: If regularization is too strong, reduce its strength to allow the model more flexibility.\n",
    "#Train Longer: Increase the number of training iterations or epochs to allow the model more time to learn from the data.\n",
